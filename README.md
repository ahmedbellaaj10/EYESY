# Eyesy
Smart hat to help visually impaired people navigate their path.

Project winner of the first edition of Makeathon inter ODC Clubs organized jointly by Orange Tunisie and GIZ Tunisie.

The Makeathon brought together 60 students from 6 different Tunisian universities: INSAT, ENISO, ENIS, ISET Kef, ISET Kairouan, ISET Nabeul.
Divided into 12 teams, we were competing under the theme of "Edge Computing and IoT": Artificial Intelligence technologies combined with the Internet of Things in order to create and prototype innovative solutions that meet one of the 17 Sustainable Development Goals.

Within 48 hours, we successfully created Eyesy: a smart hat for visually impaired
people to help them to walk easily. The hat is connected to a raspberry pi card with a pi cam that takes images when the user is walking and sends them to Edge Impulse platform. The camera is also attached to a holder printed with 3D printer and the raspberry pi connected to a power bank for power supply.
Using machine learning, the card informs the visually impaired user if there are obstacles or stairs in front of him using headphones. The AI model gave good results and more data would make the model greater and more efficient.
